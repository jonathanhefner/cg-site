title: Grouping Unrelated Spaces and Apps
weight: 40
---

Right now, the only thing that stops an agency from grouping together unrelated applications and services in a single organization to avoid paying appropriate access costs is their honor in abiding by our guideline: “No clown cars.”

We will be refining the definition of “clown car” in the future by observing common usage patterns and identifying what a reasonable count of apps-per-space and spaces-per-org looks like. Once we’ve stated a concrete definition, we’ll give a grace-period warning for any violations we observe. After that grace period, we will take action. For now, please don’t abuse the “no clown cars” guideline so we can spend less time policing abusers, and more time making the service better.

__Hint__: We don't support billing separately for some spaces in the same organization. If you find yourself wanting this, it's likely you're looking at a clown car without realizing it; there is latent separation in systems/teams implied by this pressure. In this case, please set up a new organization corresponding to a separate billing code and move the appropriate spaces from the existing organization into it. (Conversely, we have no problem with multiple organizations assigned to the same billing code.)
