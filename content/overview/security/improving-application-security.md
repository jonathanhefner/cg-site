Probably the biggest security improvement afforded by cloud.gov is that it enforces an immutable infrastructure. Instead of logging into a live system to make a change, we deploy an entirely new system with security updates applied. That ensures any foothold which might have been exploited by hackers gets wiped away at the same time.

The same is true for applications deployed on cloud.gov. When vulnerabilities in a software stack are identified, we can re-deploy applications that use it on a clean and updated baseline. This happens independently of the application teamâ€™s availability, as often as needed, and without downtime.
