## Early users
The first cloud.gov users were 18F’s own product teams. All new 18F projects launch on cloud.gov. Because teams no longer have to build the platform for their work on a project-by-project basis, the product teams stay smaller. This means we can take on more projects, increasing our impact. Our teams regularly describe the platform as a “thing going well” in reviewing their own work.

Products like Every Kid in a Park and the College Scorecard were built on the cloud.gov platform and have handled surges of traffic from media coverage and announcements by the President.

## Current users
18F is now working with a set of agencies who are willing to help us uncover and work through the challenges involved in a new service. While we aren’t yet at the point where agencies can use cloud.gov on their own, we are learning to scale support, processes, and infrastructure.

## Coming soon
We plan to make cloud.gov available to more federal agencies in the future. If you are interested in future availability, [submit your email address](https://cloud.gov/#contact).
