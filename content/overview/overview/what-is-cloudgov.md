## What is cloud.gov?

cloud.gov gives teams working for federal government a secure, fully compliant foundation, integrated with private sector infrastructure providers, on which to build and release products and updates quickly. It handles the shared technical and legal requirements common to all federal government systems, so that teams can skip a large amount of repetitive work and instead focus on delivering software that serves people’s needs. It’s built to keep applications online even with large numbers of users and sharp increases in usage.

cloud.gov is built by [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) in the [U.S. General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000). cloud.gov is a cost-recoverable service funded by charging a fee to the teams that use it. 

### cloud.gov is a Platform as a Service

cloud.gov allows federal digital service teams to focus on developing and deploying their custom application code, without needing to manage underlying server infrastructure.

The core of cloud.gov is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) built specifically for government work, based on the open source [Cloud Foundry project](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/). This means the customer team is responsible for their custom application code, and the cloud.gov platform [takes care of the security and maintenance of everything underneath]({{< relref "overview/technology/responsibilities.md" >}}).

cloud.gov runs on top of industry-provided infrastructure ([currently Amazon Web Services is our "Infrastructure as a Service" provider]({{< relref "overview/technology/iaas.md" >}})). cloud.gov removes the complexity of managing this infrastructure from the customer’s experience.

All the software components of the cloud.gov Platform as a Service are [open source](https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/repos).

### cloud.gov provides a compliance toolkit

cloud.gov provides tools for customers to create the security documentation and continuing assurance necessary for federal services to comply with FISMA regulations and agency-specific “Authority to Operate” (ATO) requirements.

We call these tools the Compliance Toolkit, including [Compliance Masonry](https://github.com/opencontrol/compliance-masonry). We created them to support cloud.gov's ATO and the ATOs of customer applications, and they're all open source. Other teams, including agencies and industry teams, can also use these tools for unrelated projects that have similar needs.
